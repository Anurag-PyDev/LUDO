# LUDO

The biggest project I have undertaken, when i undertook this project. It is a game of LUDO ( you know if you are from India ). 
It utilises the pygame module of python. the folders contain the files needed to run the game as described by their names.
It involves lot of logic and Ctrl+C V to create this page. It is not the perfect LUDO game, but I am still happy with how it turned out. 

I also have no further plans to work on it anymore, it's been enough stressing on it.

You must have pygame installed in your device to run the program, also it is for PC.
